# 🧪 Machine Learning-Based Prediction and Optimization of Deposition Rate in CVD Process

This project focuses on **predicting and optimizing the Deposition Rate (DR)** and **Uniformity Index (UI)** in the **Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD)** process using advanced **machine learning models**.  
By analyzing process parameters such as **Temperature, Pressure, Flow Rate**, and **Mole Fraction**, the models enable accurate, data-driven insights into film growth and process efficiency.
